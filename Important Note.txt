# Automating Salesforce Picklist Dependencies Using Python

Manually configuring **dependent picklists** inside Salesforce Setup is painful — especially when you have:

- 50+ countries  
- 500+ states  
- 1000+ cities  
- Multi-level dependencies  

Salesforce provides no bulk upload option for dependent picklists. You must manually select controlling values one by one — which is slow and error-prone.

This Python tool solves that problem.

## 🚀 What This Tool Automates

Instead of manually creating Salesforce **field dependencies**, this script automates:

### ✔ Generating `<valueSettings>` dependency mappings  
### ✔ Bulk assignment of controlling → dependent picklist values  
### ✔ Automatic formatting of Salesforce metadata XML  
### ✔ Backup creation before editing metadata  

You only maintain a simple Excel file like:

| Country | State |
|---------|--------|
| IND | MH |
| IND | WB |
| ARE | DUH |
| ARE | AUD |

The script reads this and automatically builds:

```
<valueSettings>
    <controllingFieldValue>IND</controllingFieldValue>
    <valueName>MH</valueName>
</valueSettings>
```

for every combination.

## 🧠 Why This Saves Time for Salesforce People

### ⏳ Before Automation  
You must:
1. Open Field Dependencies UI  
2. Select controlling picklist value  
3. Click checkboxes manually  
4. Repeat for 200+ values  

Takes **hours to days**, depending on the dataset.

### ⚡ After Automation  
- Update Excel  
- Run Python  
- Deploy metadata  

Takes **less than 10 seconds**.

Huge time saver for:

- Salesforce Admins  
- Salesforce Developers  
- Consulting/Implementation teams  
- Large Enterprise Data migration projects

## 🛠 Who Should Use This

- Anyone working with **country → state → city** picklists  
- Anyone onboarding new regions  
- Anyone migrating legacy ERP country/state data into Salesforce  
- Anyone tired of Salesforce’s Field Dependency UI 😅  

---

## 📦 Deployment Notes

Once the script generates:

```
Shipping_State__c.field-meta.updated.xml
```

Rename it and deploy using:

```
sfdx force:source:deploy -p metadata/customfields
```

or any DevOps tool.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This tool is a perfect example of using automation + metadata to bypass Salesforce UI limitations.

It reduces hours of manual clicking down to **seconds**, ensures accuracy, and makes your picklist dependency management scalable.

Use your time for real development — let Python handle the boring parts ✨
